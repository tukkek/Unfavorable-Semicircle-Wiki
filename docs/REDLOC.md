# REDLOC

♐REDLOC is a video posted to the [second YouTube account](Real_and_Fake_channels "wikilink") on March 18, 2016, after a
break of more than a week on youtube. (It was, however, posted three
days after the [second G+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_2 "wikilink") and
around the same time as the ♐[LEE](LEE "wikilink") series began on
twitter.)

## The "Announcement"

In a unique occurrence, this video was "announced" on the twitter
account (with a tweet simply reading "♐REDLOC") at around the same time
it was posted to youtube. Given that the second youtube account and the
twitter account were both new at the time, this served to reinforce that
the same user (or users) was in control of both accounts.

## Description of video

The video is 4:32 in duration. It contains a mono audio track of
heavily-distorted "calliope"/ragtime music. Although the file is named
REDLOC, the [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") spells out
"R-E-D-L-O-C-K" (with a "K") near the start of the video.

## Meaning of name

Besides conceptually relating to ♐[LOCK](LOCK "wikilink"),
♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") and ♐[RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink"), it has
been noted that REDLOC is "colder" spelled backwards.

## Composite Image

Instead of a conventional composite, this composite is a long exposure
which shows all non-black pixels at once.

## Music

In November 2024: Discord user `FFW` [cleared the music](REDLOC_homesick.mp4) in REDLOC's audio and the segment was then identified as Homesick (at the 0:47 mark). This is the same song present in [DELOCK](DELOCK) and mentioned in multiple UFSC social media communications.

## Overview

♐HARVEST is a video posted to the second youtube account on October 10, 2016. It was posted five days after the conclusion of the ♐[BROTHER](BROTHER "wikilink") series and a day before the beginning of the ♐[SLIM](SLIM "wikilink") series.

It is noteworthy in that its composite image includes a string of text
from the [Wikipedia article on "Art"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art). (see below)

## Description of video

At 9:43:20, this is one of the longest videos posted by Unfavorable
Semicircle. The visuals contain a flickering series of colored frames.

The audio is a mono track with a variety of data transmission type
sounds throughout.

### Audio analysis

There is a sort of structure to the audio, with a series of "spikes"
that sound like there are LIMIT-style noises mixed in with the data
transmission sounds. It starts with the same log-on/log-off "handshake"
noise from the end of ♐[ZUFCHO](ZUFCHO "wikilink").

The [Unknown Voice](Unknown_Voice "wikilink") speaks the letter "B" (or
possibly "E") near the start and again a number of times throughout the
video (it could be at other places, especially inside the louder spikes,
but initial analysis has found the letter repeated at 0:06:58, 1:08:48,
3:21:15, 4:20:06, 4:44:33, 6:13:34, 6:20:32, 6:25:38, 6:33:04 and
6:38:52) — there is no obvious pattern to these repetitions. Immediately
after the "loud" section ending at 4:43, the voice counts from 0 to 9.

There is an "interlude" at 6:44:33 (preceded by a handshake/log-off
sound) of quieter wump/mic bump type noises that lasts approximately
three minutes and forty-five seconds.

There are also several unusual noises throughout the video, including a
"calliope"/♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") type noise at 0:13, 5:44:33, and
data transmission tics at 6:06:45.

Further analysis, especially within the "spikes" will probably reveal
further anomalies.

## Significance of name

Besides the obvious autumnal resonance of the name, it has been noted
that the video was posted on [Canadian Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_\(Canada\)).

## Significance of composite

The ♐HARVEST composite contains three "panels" — the top half is clearly
related to the ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") composite, although the bottom
half (and the relationship between the parts) is unknown.

The angled line in the lower right section is similar to the line in
♐[RECOVER](RECOVER "wikilink").

### Text in composite

It was discovered by thomasf that the lower area of the top right
"panel" contains contains tiny text (black, with green/gray outline
around it) which cites the beginning of the [Wikipedia page for Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art):

*screencap of Wikipedia article on "Art" — note the slightly different
punctuation than used in the composite*

It is possible that this is a straightforward message from the
creator(s) of Unfavorable Semicircle that the entire project is meant to
be considered as art — or this could merely be found text placed in the
image for some other unknown reason — possibly to demonstrate that the
project's videos can be used as a means to encode "text" messages.

If is worth noting that although the ♐HARVEST video was posted on
October 10th, the version of the text from the Wikipedia article changed
from the way it is reproduced in the composite on June 21st.

  - **See also ♐[GOLDEN](GOLDEN "wikilink"), which has a similar (though
    less readable) section of text.**
    
 ##  Possible astrological connections
 
The [astrological sign of Virgo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgo_(astrology)) is associated with harvest goddess mythology.

## Docomposite

October 2024, Discord user `tukkek` decomposed the Harvest composite, with a few note-worthy images as the result:

![harvest_decompose.webp](harvest_decompose.webp)

![harvest_decompose_south.webp](harvest_decompose_south.webp)

> tukkek: bottom panel is google maps with the location markers turned on and off, isnt it? 
>
> tukkek: and perhaps the side-bar shown and hidden but inverted horizontally

![harvest_decompose_north_west.png](harvest_decompose_north_west.png)

> tukkek: theres is a shaded object in the background, same as the top of the leaf is shaded.
>
> tukkek: a person behind leaves?
>
> noxxy: yeah i can see it being some kinda odd leaves, maybe with some kinda (gooey?) liquid pouring down...
>
> noxxy: would explain the downwards orientation and the blob near the bottom left
> 
> tukkek: someone taking pictures hidden behind leaves hidden behind layers of noise hidden in one of 3 panels seems like too much to be a coincidence
>
> tukkek: is that a watermark on the corner? LMAO

A similar droplet-shaped water-mark can be seen in [Answers](ANSWERS).

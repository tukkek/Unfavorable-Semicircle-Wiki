## Overview

♐MOTH is a [series](List_of_Series "wikilink") that was uploaded to the second Youtube account. The series started on January 29th, 2017, the same day as ♐[POINT](POINT "wikilink") started on Twitter. The series ended on March 9, 2017 with ♐MOTH 55. After the end of the series, the account was quiet for two weeks before posting ♐[GOLDEN](GOLDEN "wikilink").

♐MOTH is the series with the longest total video time.

## Description of videos

Each ♐MOTH video is 9:15:33 (33333 seconds) long at 30 fps, making it a million frames per video.

It is assumed that the audio in all ♐MOTH videos is identical. The first six videos have all been tested and are identical; ♐MOTH 32 has been tested and is identical to ♐MOTH 0.

### Irregularities

  - ♐MOTH 46 was skipped in the uploading order, and the series
    continued after it.
  - ♐MOTH 47 (uploaded on March 1, 2017) was slightly shorter than a
    "regular" video on this series at 9:14:38 (33278 seconds). Although
    the audio seems substantially similar to the regular audio,
    differences in processing (or possibly deliberate tampering) have
    made it very slightly different so that it does not invert and
    "cancel out" cleanly with the audio from other MOTH videos.
  - ♐MOTH 55 has a length of 8:15:23 (29723 seconds).

## Audio

MOTH videos have a [Handshake](Handshake "wikilink") at the start.

### Spectrographic Image

The audio in ♐MOTH 0 contains a distinct visual pattern when viewed as a spectrograph (image by by `salo´):

Pattern high-light by `tukkek`:

### Further Analysis

Discord user Risto notes, "this bit \[in ♐MOTH 0\] stretches till about
15 seconds":

![Moth\_spectrograph\_1.png](Moth_spectrograph_1.png)

And adds: "Those tones stretch up to 600 Hz." This is a zoomed-in view
of the pattern above:

![Moth\_spectrograph\_1-zoom.png](Moth_spectrograph_1-zoom.png)

(Discord user alexbassguy observes, the changes are "more like 120ish hz
apart, but evenly spaced... not exponentially spaced, so they're not
overtones.")

Risto further notes that the "audio itself caps at about 16.5 kHz":

(Adding: "The vertical lines are spectral leakage, because spectrograms
are not perfect.")

## Composites

### 2-D composite

<http://tomasf.se/projects/semi/MOTH_composite.png> (*because of the
immense number of data points, this file is very large*)

### 3-D composite

*two screencaps of ♐MOTH 3-D composite by vantjac. (note that due to the
immense number of data points this is not the complete series; however,
all points from further videos fall within the same plane.)*

#### Analysis of 3-D Composite

The [3D Composite](3D_Composite "wikilink") of MOTH is a plane.

## Appearances elsewhere

Discord user ShadowMorphyn has noted that the ["other"](Real_and_Fake_channels "wikilink") [unfavorable semicircle](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCA2j2wFhXsQej79c9V4v_Lg/) channel has apparently used a ♐MOTH video as the basis of [♐♐CULLET](https://youtu.be/JZcmftIz-HM).

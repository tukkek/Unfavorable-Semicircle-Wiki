# List of glitches

Many UFSC videos have been reported to cause minor to major glitches; bugs; or issues in video-player software, including full-system crashes in Android smart-phones. Unfortunately, as software evolves and bugs have been fixed in players (including You Tube's web-player and Android's Stage Fright engine), many of these no longer occur and have not been properly documented back when they did occur.

While these problems may be unintentional (such as defects from a custom-made video-encoding process), it has also been theorized that these are side-effects of UFSC as a whole being a method of trying to subject You Tube (or its users) to penetration-testing; fuzzy-testing; or Row-hammer and Stage Fright exploits.

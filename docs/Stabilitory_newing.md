# Stabilitory newing
## Overview
Stabilitory newing was a YouTube channel created on [August 24, 2016](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEUj7apDhQq5hh87U8iP4-w/about) that started posting videos on September 3, 2016. The relationship between Stabilitory newing and UFSC was originally unclear, but was connected to UFSC by the [third Google+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_3):

- 9808 is the unicode codepoint for ♐ in decimal, while 8853 is the
  unicode codepoint for ⊕, which is the leading character in the
  titles of Stabilitory newing's posts.
- The date 2016-09-03 is the date of the first video posted the
  channel, named ⊕[BROTHER](BROTHER) 0;
  ♐[BROTHER](BROTHER) 0 was posted to UFSC's main channel
  on 2016-09-23, the second date in the G+ post.

The channel was confirmed as "REAL" in the [fourth Google+ post](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_4).

## Videos
- In September 2016, the channel initially posted a series titled
  ⊕[BROTHER](BROTHER), which consisted of 55 videos.
- On May 17, 2017, a standalone video named ⊕[RATE](RATE)
  was posted.
- Later that same day, the ⊕[BELT](BELT) series began.

## Possible significance of name
Anagrams of "stabilitory newing":
- "initial bytes wrong"
- "login is betray twin"
    - "Twin" could be a reference to the zodiac sign Gemini, which is
      the opposite sign to Sagittarius ('Betrayed by the Twins?')

## Work on finding information in the visuals
Earlier work focused on [treating the "histograms" as a source of data](Investigation_into_color_data_in_SN_visuals). Interest was renewed after the June 2022 ♐️[ANSWERS](ANSWERS) tweet specifically said that "yes, there are Stabilitory Newing composites".

In June 2025, user `N25_CT13` found composites in SN's videos:
> N25_CT13: the "image like shapes" only seem to show up on columns `3, 4, [8 to 14] and [19 to 36]` (with 27 image columns and 23 "noise" columns)
>
> N25_CT13: the method for those "composites" is basically taking the amount of white pixels in each column as value, normalizing the value to match the image pixel range for a brighter image (divide by 38, multiply by 255) and then wrapping the values into an image like a regular composite.

> tukkek: 38 is the area?

> N25_CT13: i think yeah. the height is 38 pixels

> N25_CT13: note that i only took data each 30 frames for brother and 2 frames for belt to make it match the composite size.

The Numpy and space-separated data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ufscwiki/Unfavorable-Semicircle-Wiki/blob/master/docs/SN.7z).

> N25_CT13: brother, 100x100, third column

> tukkek: looks a bit like a ♐ pointing north-west, doesnt it?
>
> N25_CT13: or maybe two Semicircles

> N25_CT13: belt, 365x365, third column

This happened years after [Answers](ANSWERS) claimed there were SN composites to be found, legitimizing it as an authentic message.

## Removal
The Twitter account was deleted (apparently by the author(s)
[Unfavorable Semicircle](Unfavorable_Semicircle) itself) at
the time ♐[RESET\_STRANGE\_YD](RESET_STRANGE_YD) was
uploaded.

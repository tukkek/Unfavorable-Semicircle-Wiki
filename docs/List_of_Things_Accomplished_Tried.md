# List of Things Accomplished & Tried

(*Adapted from
[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4cv2e9/unfavorablesemicircle_start_here/)
reddit thread. Some of these have been discussed further or have
possibly been tentatively dismissed on other threads.*)

(*This may not be exhaustive or up-to-date!*)

## Successful ideas

  - Combining frames into [composites](Video_Composites "wikilink")
    (this began with ♐[RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink") and has been
    subsequently applied to most videos)
  - Creating [3D Composites](3D_Composite "wikilink") from the
    composites. The clearest example is with
    [BREADTH](BREADTH "wikilink"), it is unclear whether any others are
    meant to be viewed this way.
  - digging through recordings on [wax cylinder](http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/index.php) and [78 rpm records](http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/) to identify the song in
    ♐[RETIO](RETIO "wikilink"). **UPDATE:** The song has tentatively
    been identified as the 1922 recording of "Away Down East In Maine"
    by Miss Patricola with the Virginians.
  - efforts have been made to [reverse engineer](Reverse_Engineering_Attempts "wikilink") the videos, or to
    understand the process by building new videos "from the ground up".

## Needing further investigation

Below is a short list of things that have been tried/discussed, feel
free to revisit these or use them as a starting point.

  - creating [XOR](Google_Plus#G.2B_post_3 "wikilink") composites (such
    as was done with ♐[FOND](FOND "wikilink"))
  - finding a common method of pitch shifting and/or speeding up/slowing
    down videos (so far this hasn't shown any interesting results, but
    isn't something that should be ruled out)
  - discovering if images are viable as Piet Code. Piet is a [graphical programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Piet).
    It uses images that are vaguely similar to UFSC images. An [effort was made](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48n3p0/ufsc_attempting_to_run_delock_as_a_piet_code/)
    to run ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink") as Piet, but it didn't go too
    far
  - analysis of frame durations [was done](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48gv41/analysis_of_delock_image_durations/)
    on ♐[DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink").
  - furthering work with [bulk transcription](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/48slsm/partial_bulk_transcription_of_numbered_videos/)
    of the audio (such as was done with ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink")) and
    finding ways to analyze the results
  - finding if composites or other images could be related to [4D color barcodes](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/49s59l/patent_4d_color_barcode_for_high_capacity_data/)
    used for high capacity data encoding and decoding
  - [analyzing audio for encoded data streams](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4b3c5n/theory_audio_is_fsk_encoded_data_stream/)
    (such as FSK)
  - investigating further if ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") is related to
    Brill tagging or the [Brill Building Sound](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4bpzpl/the_brill_building_sound_by_1962_the_brill/)
  - analyzing anagrams: there have been many threads on anagrams, with
    no substantial results
  - working to discover the very meaning of the phrase *Unfavorable
    Semicircle*
  - analyzing ♐[CAB](CAB "wikilink") videos ([for .cab files](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnfavorableSemicircle/comments/4c7822/all_cab_videos_zip_file/))
    or embedded audible binary
  - applying further analysis to the composites to confirm if they are
    indeed different images of the same thing (possibly at different
    zoom levels)
  - interpreting the message in ♐[CREM](CREM "wikilink")
  - analyzing existing data to confirm the linkages between them.
    (*i.e.* how, precisely do the short and long
    ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") videos relate? Are they the same frames
    repackaged? Are ♐[BRILL](BRILL "wikilink") and
    ♐[BRINE](BRINE "wikilink") similarly related?)
  - reverse-engineering the process used to create the distortion and
    other audio effects in the UFSC videos; finding if there is a reason
    for the use of [DC offset](DC_offset "wikilink") and other
    unorthodox audio engineering techniques
  - figuring out how deliberate encoding errors (found in
    ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink") and many more videos) are being
    introduced to the videos
  - It has been demonstrated that the ♐[DEPTH](DEPTH "wikilink") videos
    contain 100 discrete sounds, and they seem to be sounds recycled
    from other videos. Further analysis is needed to find out more about
    these sounds: can they be assembled into one continuous message? Is
    the use of 100 pieces a sign of a code or hidden puzzle?
  - ♐[FOND](FOND "wikilink") videos are listed on youtube with a length
    of 27:45. But they play as video (and open in Audacity) with a
    length of 23:45. Do these videos have three "hidden" minutes like in
    ♐[LIMIT](LIMIT "wikilink")?
  - Some videos appear to have identical sounds to previously-posted
    videos when they are sped up or slowed down. (*e.g.*
    ♐[LOCUS](LOCUS "wikilink")'s soundtrack transforms into data
    transmission-type sounds when sped up several hundred times.) Is
    this the same audio that is in other videos? What is the
    significance of this?
  - Verifying exactly where the Lame 3.99.5 tags on
    [LOVE](LOVE "wikilink") are coming from. Checking if other videos
    have them.
  - Studying which dates and times UFSC uses to upload his content and
    seeing if any pattern emerges
  - Creating 3D composites of interesting sections of an image (like
    with [HARVEST](HARVEST "wikilink")).
  - Layering composites of videos over each other
  - Discord user Parogar found [a selfie-type image](Spokeo_selfie "wikilink") (via spokeo.com) allegedly
    associated with the email unfavorablesemicircle@gmail.com
  - A fuller examination of [Video scopes](Video_scopes "wikilink"),
    including other composites and vectorscopes. Integrating the more
    interesting scopes into [the composite overview](Composite_visual_overview "wikilink")
    would also be welcome.
  - [Investigation into color data in SN visuals](Investigation_into_color_data_in_SN_visuals "wikilink")
    (see Follow-up section).
  - There's a claim on the [♐LOCK](LOCK "wikilink") article that slowing down the video 4x makes the audio easier to read as morse code. Between the size of archives and possible playbacks speeds without distoring the audio track too much (both faster and slower), that approach could be taken with a lot of videos.
  - Creating composites from different pixel coordinates, such as [this experiment based on the ♐LOCK keyhole heat-map](lock_heatmap_composites.pdf).
  - Creating more [audio composites](audio_composites "wikilink").
  - Creating 3D composites using RYB, CMY, HSV and HSL rather than RGB.
  - Create more decomposites like the one in [Harvest](harvest).
    - A newbie-friendly guide has been provided: https://imgur.com/a/decomposing-guide-xto0OgC
    - Also: trying to recompose the decomposed layers, perhaps using different colors.
  - Try to decode LOCK's audio as GSM data:

## Description of video

The video is 1:34 in length. The visuals contain a series of white
shapes on a black background. Unusually, the audio is "synced" to the
visuals (*i.e.* the soundtrack is quiet while the screen is static.)

## Audio analysis

The audio track is highly amplified like many other videos and has a
motor like with a clicking noise every repeating several times per
second.

## Composites

## Relationship with ♐RECOVER

Discord user `N25_CT13` notes:

> also about those videos

> recover has the thing at around 3 seconds and crimp has it at the start

Perhaps the names of these videos ("crimp" or "to compress" and "recover" or "return to original state") imply a similar dynamic to that of [♐LOCK](LOCK "wikilink")-[♐DELOCK](DELOCK "wikilink")-[♐RELOCK](RELOCK "wikilink").

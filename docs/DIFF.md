## Audio

The 42 second video consists of flashing colors, with a beat repeating
every few seconds.

Wiki user Malcolm has noted that the audio sounds like music with a
large amount of interference laid on top of it, with a repeating beat.

Discord user alexbassguy notes: "I know EXACTLY how that audio was
created, and it's very incongruous with 'real' UFSC. I know because I
happen to have the exact same plugin that was used... a plugin called
Glitch2 from Illformed. It creates a very, very specific rhythmic glitch
effect on audio, and I will bet any amount of money it created the audio
in DIFF." He created a recreation "by running Glitch2 on some basic
audio and distorting/downsampling the crap out of it."
